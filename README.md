# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-and-Logistics-Regression

I Consider the dataset used for prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective.  The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.  (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)

(a)	Create a new variable “Admission_Status” based on the criteria, if Chance_of_Admit >= 0.7 - Admit(1) and otherwise Do not admit (0) and condunct Linear discrimianat function analysis (LDA) for two clases.

(b) Create the second new variable “Admission_Status2” with three classes based on the criteria, if (Chance_of_Admit >= 0.8) - Admit (1) else if (0.8 > Chance_of_Admit >= 0.5) - Borderline (2) and otherwise Do not admit (3). Continue LDA with three clases to have two discriminant functions.

(c) Develop a classification rule using logistic regression.
